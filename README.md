# Notepad Application

This is a simple text editor application developed in Java. I know it is not perfect, but it has a didactic purpose.
It was initially created for an exam, but I've added a couple additional features. 
The application is expected to be further enhanced in the future.

## Features

- Basic text editing capabilities
- Open, Save, Save As, New File, Close and a very basic text search.
